# walkre

walkre is a collection of utility functions that relate to geolocation and transport. It is intended primarily for my own personal use at this point, we'll see what comes of it.

Presently it is a simple NodeJs server that responds to various API calls. These API calls are the `exports` in the file `server/api.js`. You can see samples of how to call these APIs in the comments in `server/app.js`.

These APIs are presently probably not of much interest, as `qryq`, the spin-off project from this. You can find `qryq`:
